\section*{Professional Summary}
I am a seventh--semester Computer Science student at the University of Havana with a strong mathematical background and proven achievements in international problem-solving competitions. My passion for mathematics began at the age of \textbf{8}, when I first became involved in high-performance problem solving and Olympiad-style mathematics, a path I have consistently pursued ever since.  

As a three-time member of the Cuban National Mathematical Team, I earned a \textbf{silver medal at the Central American Mathematical Olympiad (2019)} and two \textbf{bronze medals at the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad (2020, 2021)}. Additionally, I am a \textbf{five-time participant in the Iranian Geometry Olympiad (IGO)}, obtaining \textbf{two bronze medals and three honorable mentions} across both intermediate and advanced levels.  

Beyond the high school level, I have also competed in \textbf{university-level mathematical Olympiads}, extending my experience to advanced contexts of problem solving and further strengthening my preparation.  

In addition to my participation as a contestant, I currently serve as an \textbf{active member of the training group for the Cuban National Mathematics Team}, where I contribute to the preparation of students in areas such as \textbf{Geometry, Number Theory, Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Functional and Infinitesimal Analysis, and Linear Algebra}. I act as the \textbf{lead instructor in Geometry and Number Theory}, designing problem sets, guiding students through advanced concepts, and mentoring them for international competitions.
